# Overview
This is an implementation of ZUC using Python. When the programs executed, the time of encrypting 640000 bits and whether the encrypting is succeed are displayed on the console.

# Description
- All of the programs in this repository will show the time of encrypting 640000bits and whether the encrypting is succeed when executed.
- The programs with the suffix called "RasPico" assume that you run the ZUC with Python on Raspberry Pi Pico. When the programs exected, the results are displayed on the screen.
- The programs without suffix called "RasPico" assume that you run the ZUC with Python on PC. When the programs exected, the results are displayed on the console.
- The programs with the prefix "Optimized" are programs that speeds up the program with no prefix.
